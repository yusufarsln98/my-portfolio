		description:
			'The Java programming language is a language that belongs to the group “C-Family Languages”. However, there are many differences between C and Java programming languages, especially in their programming paradigms. In addition, we have to say that there are many similarities, especially in syntax, between the Java programming language, which is known to have been heavily influenced by C, and the C programming language, which is one of Java’s ancestors.
